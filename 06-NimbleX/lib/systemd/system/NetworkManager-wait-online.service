[Service]
# `nm-online -s` waits until the point when NetworkManager logs
# "startup complete". That is when startup actions are settled and
# devices and profiles reached a conclusive activated or deactivated
# state. It depends on which profiles are configured to autoconnect and
# also depends on profile settings like ipv4.may-fail/ipv6.may-fail,
# which affect when a profile is considered fully activated.
# Check NetworkManager logs to find out why wait-online takes a certain
# time.

# Set $NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT variable for timeout in seconds.
# Edit with `systemctl edit NetworkManager-wait-online`.
#
# Note, this timeout should commonly not be reached. If your boot
# gets delayed too long, then the solution is usually not to decrease
# the timeout, but to fix your setup so that the connected state
# gets reached earlier.
